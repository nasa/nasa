Hi :wave:, welcome to the NASA org on github.com! 

Github.com/nasa has one of the largest collections of NASA open-source code repositories. Members of the NASA org can find instructions for github.com/nasa in <a href="http://nasa.github.io/">http://nasa.github.io/</a>. 

ðŸ”­ Additional open-source code repositories resides in a variety of locations other than github.com/nasa. To discover code across all of these locations, we suggest you use code.nasa.gov & software.nasa.gov. These are two different sites holding metadata that describe code projects. Any code released through the NASA Software Release Authority process should be cataloged on those sites.

- [`Code.nasa.gov`](https://code.nasa.gov) &mdash; Is a page with short descriptions of all of NASA's open-source code. Code.nasa.gov feeds into code.gov, which covers open-source and government-source code form many different U.S. governmental agencies. To assist in discovery, code projects described on code.nasa.gov have both human and A.I.-generated tags. These can be useful for finding related code projects.
- [`software.nasa.gov`](https://software.nasa.gov) &mdash; Contains metadata descriptions for all the code projects in code.nasa.gov as well as government-source code proects only sharable with other government agencies. To help discoverabiliy, it has a smaller number of categories to describe the purpose of the code. Each code project is grouped into one of the catagories. The categories, include: Business Systems and Project Management, System Testing, Operations, Design and Integration Tools, Vehicle Management (Space/Air/Ground), Data Servers Processing and Handling, Propulsion, Structures and Mechanisms, Crew and Life Support, Data and Image Processing, Materials and Processes, Electronics and Electrical Power, Environmental Science (Earth, Air, Space, Exoplanet), Autonomous Systems, and Aeronautics.
